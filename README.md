# Vision

Hello fellow collaborators!

This project is a personal finance tool, designed by and for software engineers. I welcome you to use and collaborate to this project as you see fit.

I'll start by explaining my vision for this tool.

I am a young software engineer. For the first time in my life I am making real money, and spending it. I need to make a concious effort to spend, save, and invest money in a way that furthers my personal goals, hobbies, aspirations and so on. This tool is my way of avoiding the hour or two a month I'd normally spend checking my bank statements by spending dozens of hours producing a tool to automate it for me.

At it's most basic I envision this tool to be a CLI python application that parses your statements, allows the setup of "buckets" (spending/allocation categores such as: groceries, housing, health, discretionary..."), and provides insight into the ways you spend your money through the use of said buckets. The application will offer a wide range of graphic tools powered by matplotlib, allowing the user to verify they meet their spending/saving goals.

A more advanced feature I'd like to add is a retirement model and simulation CLI. This interface allows the user to input their current income/spending/savings and expected growth throughout their career, along with their expected income/spending during retirement; to model which kind of investment accounts (401k/IRA, Traditional/Roth...) would work best given the S&P 500 growth rate (or user defined growth rate).

## Collaboration
I wish this project to have a low bar to collaboration. We're just a group of coders trying to be responsible adults and have fun doing it!

If you wish to collaborate, please clone the project, and branch out of main. I have made the project public, at the cost of a protected main branch only I can modify.
I've never worked on an open-source project so let this be a collaborate working experience, and an open forum.

When you have made changes you'd like to introduce to the main branch, please send a merge request with explanation for what you are doing, why, and how you achieving your goals.
If the changes you made match your explanation and are sufficiently documented, I will eagerly approve it following a little testing.

I'm looking to levarage the issue board/wiki to make collaboration seamless, please throw me your ideas!

### Documentation
Please, please, please leave descriptive comments explaining what a section of code does, why it works the way it does, and what your reasoning is for writing code the way you did.
I welcome your ideas for better documentation, for now, try to aim for Literate Programming through in-line comments. Also, when merging back to main, try to squash commits and leave a clean, sensible commit history that helps explain this software's story.

Code should tell a computer what to do, comments should tell humans wtf is going on and **why**.
